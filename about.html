                            <p>
                                In 1990, my sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 29 and had to undergo a unilateral mastectomy. Being the young, stylish woman that she was – fashion was very important to her. Finding your everyday clothing items such as bras, swimwear, and shirts was a challenge for her. She always was looking in the mirror, asking if I could tell, wearing really large clothes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While on this journey with my sister, it became apparent to me that there had to be other women out there dealing with the same issue. That’s when Sheri’s Finishing Touch was born.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was by my sister’s side every step of the way and learned the challenges that come with this disease. With my 28 years of medical experience, my goal is to bring comfort, style, and support to you.
                            </p>
