                                    <p>Q: What is a breast form?</p>
                                    <p>A: A breast form is an external prosthesis that can be worn inside the pocket of a bra. Breast forms are designed to resemble natural breast tissue and are therefore made of silicone.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Q: Why do I need to wear a breast form?</p>
                                    <p>A: Wearing a breast form will help you to restore the weight that's missing from your chest wall. Even though wearing a breast form can enhance your overall appearance, not wearing one can cause physical alterations as well.  A weighted breast form will restore your body's natural balance. It will prevent spinal curvature, shoulder drop, and lower back and neck pain.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Q: How do I clean my breast form?</p>
                                    <p>A: Clean your breast form daily in lukewarm water with mild soap. Dry off with a soft towel. Once clean, store your breast form, nipple side down in the travel case provided.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>A: Clean your breast form daily in lukewarm water with mild soap. Dry off with a soft towel. Once clean, store your breast form, nipple side down in the travel case provided.</p>

                                    <p>Q: What happens if I puncture my breast form?</p>
                                    <p>A: Your breast form is not covered under warranty if punctured. Since Medicare and most private insurance providers will only cover one breast prosthesis (two if you're bilateral) every 2 years, then it's extremely important that you take all necessary precautions to preserve your breast form. This means storing your breast form in the travel case when not in use and staying away from sharp objects.</p>

                                    <p>Q: Can I swim in my breast form?</p>
                                    <p>A: It is recommended that you opt for a swim form which was designed specifically for swimming. ABC offers 2 swim forms from which you can choose.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Q: How long will my breast form last?</p>
                                    <p>A: Breast forms have a life expectancy of 2 years. Medicare and most private insurances grant you an allowable for a new prosthesis every 2 years. If you have a bilateral, you're allowed 2 breast forms every 2 years.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Q: Is there a breast form that keeps me cool?</p>
                                    <p>A: If you're looking for a cooler breast form, the patented Massage Form Â® was proven to reduce perspiration when compared to a standard back breast form. The special channels on the back layer allow air to circulate between you and the form. View more information about the Massage Forms Â®.</p>

                                    <p>Q: Can I get a lighter breast form?</p>
                                    <p>A: Our Lightweight breast forms and Ultra Light breast forms are lighter when compared to standard silicone. Ultra Light is an exclusive creation from ABC. Having a weighted breast form is important, but we know that too much weight can become cumbersome. Depending on your preference, ABC provides 3 different types of silicone: standard, lightweight and ultra light. Lightweight and ultra light are respectively 30% and 45% lighter than standard silicone.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>Q: I need to restore symmetry after a lumpectomy, reconstruction or breast conserving surgery. What will work best for me?</p>
                                    <p>A: Shapers, also known as partials, are designed to restore symmetry, helping you achieve a balanced look and feel. ABC provides a variety of shapers depending upon your need.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Q: Will people be able to tell the difference between my natural breast and my breast form?</p>
                                    <p>A: No, breast form technology has made great strides. With a proper fitting, you will find the right breast form and bra to make you look balanced and feel confident. As an added measure, it's helpful to know that our silicone breast forms are completely "huggable". So don't worry about the feel of your breast forms. No one will be able to tell. Your breast form will pass the "hug test" with flying colors!</p>

                                <li>
                                    <p>Q: Why should I be seen by a certified fitter?</p>
                                    <p>A: Every woman is different â so is every bra and every best form. It's best to have a certified fitter help you look at what works best for your size, frame and build.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Q: What should I do if my breast size changes before I'm due for a replacement?</p>
                                    <p>A: Before you go for another fitting, you should check with your doctor. You need to have another prescription in order for your insurance cover another breast form(s).</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Q: Can I wear a breast form without wearing a pocketed post-mastectomy bra?</p>
                                    <p>A: Yes, you can, but you may find it easier to wear a pocketed bra that was designed to hold the weight of a breast form. Other bras may not be able to sustain the weight of the breast form. A post-mastectomy bra gives you the added security that you need.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Q: When should I start wearing a breast form?</p>
                                    <p>A: Immediately following your surgery, you should be seen by a fitter. It is recommended that you get fitted with a non-silicone form. This should be worn for at least 6 weeks after your surgery.  When your doctor determines that you're ready for a weighted prosthesis, then he/she will write you a prescription for a silicone breast form.  A silicone breast form has a guaranteed life of 2 years.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>Q: Is silicone safe to use?</p>
                                    <p>A: Silicone is deemed a safe material to use in the production of an external breast prosthesis.</p>

                            <ul>

                                    <p>Q: What's the difference between a post-mastectomy bra and regular bra?</p>
                                    <p>A: Post-mastectomy bras are designed with a pocket on the inside of the bra cup. This pocket is designed to hold your breast prosthesis in place. Additionally, there are design features that allow for the added weight of a silicone breast form. There are a variety of bras because there are a variety of women. A certified fitter will consult with you to determine which bra works best for you.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Q: How many bras will my insurance cover?</p>
                                    <p>A: Medicare and most insurance providers will usually cover several bras up to a 3 month supply each time. To be certain, ask your doctor to specify the number of bras on your prescription. Also check with your insurance provider before visiting your fitter.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Q: How will I know which bra will work the best for me?</p>
                                    <p>A: Every woman is designed differently. It's best to be fitted by a certified mastectomy fitter before you purchase your post-mastectomy bra. The fitter will consult with you to determine if a seamless molded cup works better than a soft cup bra. Regardless of how much you think you know about bras, it's always best to see how it fits on you. When choosing a bra you want to consider three things: comfort, confidence, and ease of wear.</p>

                                    <p>A: In your search to find the right bra, you will discover that many post-mastectomy bras by ABC are designed to reflect the current fashion trends in the market. There are a number of bras that provide the beauty you want as well as the support you need.</p>

                                    <p>A: Medicare and most private insurance providers usually cover one silicone breast form every two years. If you had a bilateral mastectomy, then you are normally entitled to two silicone breast forms every two years. For non-silicone prostheses, Medicare and most insurance providers normally allow one form every 6 months. Non-silicone breast forms are commonly used immediately after surgery and for leisure wear. Wait at least 6 weeks after surgery or based on your doctor's recommendation before you transition into a silicone breast form.</p>

                                    <p>Q: Is there anything I need to bring to my first fitting appointment?</p>
                                    <p>A: Make sure that you have a prescription from your doctor. This will help the fitter know exactly what you need and what needs to be covered by your insurance. Both a breast prosthesis and post-mastectomy bra require a prescription.</p>

                                    <p>Q: What happens if I lose (gain) weight and need to change my breast prosthesis and/or bra?</p>
                                    <p>A: If you experience weight loss or gain and require a new prosthesis and/or bra, you must have a prescription from your doctor. There must be a weight gain or loss of 20 lbs. in order for your doctor to write another prescription. This prescription is required for insurance reimbursement.</p>
